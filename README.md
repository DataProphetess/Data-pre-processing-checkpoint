2.	What is the data type of the 'client_0_bills' variable ?
3.	Display the general information of the dataset and try to answer the following questions : 
o	How many rows and columns do we have in this dataset ?
o	How many categorical features are present in the dataset ?
o	How much memory space does the dataset consume ?
4.	Inspect the dataset for potential missing values.
5.	Select your strategy to handle missing values, and tell us why you had made that choice.
6.	Run a descriptive analysis on numeric features (columns).
7.	Select the bills records for the client with an id ='train_Client_0', using 2 methods.
8.	Transform the 'counter_type' feature to a numeric variable using the encoder of your choice.
9.	Delete the 'counter_statue' feature from the Dataframe
